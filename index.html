                            <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science and Applications from <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">The State University of New York at Buffalo</a>, where my studies have focused on Cloud Technologies, Advanced Data Engineering, and Machine Learning. My academic journey has encompassed a broad range of subjects, including Statistical Data Mining, Database Management Systems, and Probability and Data Analysis. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the prestigious <a href="https://iitbhu.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi</a>, which provided a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, eventually guiding me toward the dynamic and evolving fields of Data Science and Engineering.</p>

                            <p><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> My technical skill set is comprehensive and adaptable, with proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and SQL. I am also well-versed in a range of data engineering frameworks and tools, including Apache Spark, Databricks, Apache Airflow, Kafka, and Terraform. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Snowflake, where I have designed and managed scalable data solutions. My expertise extends to machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, enabling me to build and deploy advanced analytics solutions. These skills, combined with my experience in real-time data streaming and container orchestration using Kubernetes, position me to effectively tackle complex data engineering challenges.</p>


                            <p><strong>Professional Roles:</strong> My career in data engineering and cloud technologies has been shaped by a series of impactful roles:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Data Engineering Intern at NBCUniversal:</strong> At NBCUniversal, I played a critical role in migrating over 250 data pipelines from Apache Airflow and BigQuery to Databricks and Snowflake, resulting in a 40% improvement in data processing efficiency and a 25% reduction in query response times. I also integrated Tightlock API to streamline data transfer processes, enhancing consistency and security.</li>
                                <li><strong>Senior Data Engineer at EXL Services:</strong> In this role, I led the deployment of Apache Airflow and Kubernetes for a major telecommunications conglomerate, optimizing data pipeline performance by 50%. I was responsible for managing the Airflow cluster and ensuring smooth operation, contributing to the success of a popular streaming service.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Engineer at BizAcuity Solutions:</strong> At BizAcuity, I collaborated closely with business teams to develop PySpark jobs using AWS Glue, optimizing data flows, and transforming data for summary tables in Redshift. My efforts significantly improved the efficiency of the development workflow.</li>
                                <li><strong>ETL Developer at BizAcuity Solutions:</strong> In this early role, I led a team in optimizing ETL processes and building an in-house BI tool, which resulted in a 30% reduction in data processing time and enhanced the efficiency of Tableau visualizations and data reporting.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> As a graduate student at <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">The State University of New York at Buffalo</a>, pursuing a Master’s in Data Science, I am passionate about harnessing the power of cloud technologies and advanced data engineering to solve complex problems. With over five years of hands-on experience, I have honed my skills in building scalable data solutions, optimizing data pipelines, and driving real-time analytics. My expertise lies in seamlessly integrating cloud platforms with robust data engineering frameworks, ensuring efficient and innovative outcomes. I am particularly interested in exploring cutting-edge technologies in big data and machine learning, and I am eager to contribute to dynamic teams that are pushing the boundaries of data-driven decision-making.</p>
